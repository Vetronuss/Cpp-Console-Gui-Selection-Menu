# Cpp-Console-Gui-Selection-Menu
This is a C++ selection menu that could be used  for a text adventure game or any other programs that require a nice gui to navigate. This could also be taken apart for a games keybinds. I haven't seen a good console based gui in repl yet so I thought I would give it a shot. This program mainly uses ncurses for keystrokes and for drawing the menu.
